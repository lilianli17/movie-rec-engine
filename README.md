# Movify

## Motivation
The primary goal of this full-stack webpage project is to provide users with a platform to search for movies and get recommendations based on their preferences. With an overwhelming number of movies available and the rise of streaming services, finding a good one can be daunting. This project aims to simplify the movie selection process providing users with a comprehensive database of movies that they can explore and receive personalized recommendations from.

## Features
This web application provides movie search, collection search, and recommendation web pages to allow users to search for movies by various criteria, such as title, genre, collection, release year, and runtime. Additionally, users can input their preferred genres and ratings to receive personalized recommendations, which helps them make informed decisions about which movies to watch. With these features, Movify not only simplifies movie selection through engaging experience, but also helps users discover new movies and broaden their horizons, leading to a more diverse and enriching movie-watching experience.

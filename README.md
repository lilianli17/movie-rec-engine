## Motivation
We are developing this movie recommendation application to provide users with good movie recommendations based on genres, directors, specific movies, etc. that they like.

## Features
The list of features we definitely implement include: recommend movies based on user input about what they like (movie genre, director, specific movies, etc.), provide a brief description of the movie, list the cast and crew of the movie, link movies to their imdb pages, allow users to explore and browse under one or more general category

The list of features we might implement include: showing the trailer of the movie (pull from youtube), show similar movies within a specific movie page
